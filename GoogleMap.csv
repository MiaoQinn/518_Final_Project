3,Broadway Oyster Bar,5,"Loved it! They were very accommodating with producing dairy free options. They have plenty of meat and fish options on their menu. The flavors, vibe, and employees were nothing short of amazing!  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for oysters, fish, Cajun,  Louisiana style flavors.
They do have crawfish and gator on their menu. Plenty of seating inside the building or inside their outdoor tent (still warm even with the winter temperatures)

5,Broadway Oyster Bar,5,"Went for lunch on a Monday.  We sat at the bar and were greeted immediately.  I had 10 raw oysters (only $1ea, M-F), and the Shrimp Voodoo Tacos.  My wife had the sampler platter and some sort of creamy cake with a caramel sauce.  The food came out very quickly and it was all delicious; I wish I could eat more. The food here was really, really good.  The decor is fun, Cajun-quirky with a lot of musically-themed artifacts (they have live music 7 days a week).  There's a bit of cool history here, too - some of the original building from 1843 is still in use.  Maybe my new favorite restaurant in St. Louis.

9,Broadway Oyster Bar,5,Yes Oyster Bar. Everything we ordered was amazing. It was my first time trying oysters and the Oysters Rockefeller is the way to go. 6 oysters to an order was about $17 but worth it for sure. This time around I didn't get to order from the original menu. There was a featured crawfish festival menu that had tons of items to choose from. I went with fried crawfish tails. So light and buttery (no sides included). My table also ordered the shrimp Po boy and a bread pudding. The bill totaled at like $80 with a decent tip included. I would recommend if you're in the mood for any seafood but don't get too dressed up this place has full on casual vibes. Service was great and the ambience was very unique.

11,Broadway Oyster Bar,5,"My friend: you want to go to a local spot?
Me: yep
Off we go to this awesome place near the angry beaver about 10 minutes away from our hotel. We waited for about 30 minutes but ooo I would have waited for an hour if they told me too after experiencing what I ate.
We sat down and instantly made friends with the table next to us. They even let us taste their alligator cheesecake and we had no words for the joy that overwhelmed our taste buds. Plus, we ate off a strangers plate, my mom would normally say no to this sort of thing, but‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
We then ordered what the other table next to us said which was the red beans and rice and oops we got a cup of the gumbo on accident, but we didn‚Äôt know so we ate it. Then came the red beans, both were delicious.
We were in heaven by the time the oysters came and decided to order two different kinds. One had bacon cream sauce‚Ä¶ yes, please
Dessert was a must and they only had one so it was an easy choice. Bread pudding and it was like breakfast and dessert and it all the spots.

20,Broadway Oyster Bar,5,"Broadway Oyster Bar was all that and then some! My friend and I were in the search for some seafood. This place was recommended by someone trustworthy, and they did not disappoint. Let's just say we started out with oysters. Two different kinds. And they both were marvelous. The Char-grilled Oysters and the Oysters Nola were excellent. Then we tried another appetizer. The Alligator Sausage and Shrimp Cheesecake was savory and extremely delicious. Then for my meal I chose the Crawfish Enchiladas. Can we say OH... MY... GOSHHHHHH! So SOOO very good. It comes with Jambalaya too. My friend had an appetizer for her meal. The Blue Crab Cakes. There were three of them, each on top of a fried green tomato. It was delicious, but a little too much filling for our liking. We were thoroughly satisfied overall with the food. We will definitely come back. And we DEFINITELY recommend your trying out Broadway Oyster Bar. The service is awesome. And everyone is friendly. Thanks guy! Until NEXT time...",0.367375,0.534,0,0,1
21,Broadway Oyster Bar,5,"The food, atmosphere, and service was absolutely perfect. We had no issues at all.

We started our supper with char-grilled oysters. They came to the table hot and perfectly seasoned. They were a good size and very flavorful. It was $16.99 for a half dozen.

The menu states that their food is spicy because that's their style. I enjoyed the spiciness of my dish, my friend's was a little too spicy for her (she doesn't normally eat anything spicy). My friend had the Mahi Mahi Chef's Special which came on a bed of risotto with mushrooms and jalapenos. She said it was very spicy even after she removed the jalapenos, but when I tried it I would have rated it mild to medium spicy if you are used to eating spicy food. I had the Crawfish Enchiladas with fresh pico de Gallo and homemade jambalaya. They came with a delicious, creamy cheese sauce on top. They were medium spicy in my opinion, which was perfect for me. The jambalaya that came with it was more on the ""hot"" side of spicy. It was very flavorful too!

One of the other friends at our table had crab cakes, which she said was not spicy at all. They were smaller crab cakes but there were several of them on the plate. This crab cakes came on a fried green tomato and had a delicious sauce on them.

The fourth person had jambalaya, rice and garlic Parmesan french fries. His dish was almost too spicy for him but he ate most of his. He said the fries were delicious and the garlic Parmesan was really flavorful.

We did not have dessert. We did have drinks from the bar
I had a Berry Margarita and someone else at our table had a Rum Runner. My drink was delicious and generous with the alcohol. My friend said her drink was way too strong. I think they are perhaps a little heavy with the alcohol, but it was still tasty!

We highly recommend Broadway Oyster Bar for great food and good, strong cocktails! You MUST try the char-grilled oysters if you love oysters!",0.35746867167919794,0.5492042606516291,0,0,1

Service, though new was great- attentive, knowledgeable, and prompt.  There are 3 menu items that were mouth-wateringly good and are must try. The Cuba Missouri is a local version of a Cubano but with mojo smoke pork with layered thin sliced meat and an addictive sauce on brioche bun.  The tomato bisque is made with fresh ingredients, not too heavy on the cream, perfect basil and seasonings and even has a fruity plum-like undertone that is a delight... extremely well done.

We found the place online and it looked really cute and intimate (which atmosphere was) and had good reviews. We arrived at 9:50pm and they close at 11pm. As soon as we walked in, the woman that greeted us (maybe the owner?) said the kitchen was closed. We said we just came for drinks to which she replied last call was in ten minutes. No ‚Äúhi, how are you, welcome‚Äù etc. and it was strange that last call would be an hour before closing. We sat at the bar and waited a good 10ish minutes before someone took our drink order despite the fact that it wasn‚Äôt that busy and again she was was super rude. Other bar employees were taking shots and tasting beers at the end of the bar right next to us while we had been waiting to order. The bar staff were really inattentive and seem bothered by questions about the extensive drink selection. The part that got both of us, is that another couple walked in about five minutes after we finally got our drinks (and supposedly after last call) and we‚Äôre treated completely differently.

The host wasn't wearing a mask, which was off-putting. If I wasn't very hungry and exhausted, I would have turned around and left, but I am growing exhausted of begging people to do what they need to do to keep their neighbors safe. I can't explain to you that you should care about other people. Anyway, all the other staff had masks on.

The waitress was attentive and did a great job, especially considering how many tables she had.

The French Onion Soup was really good. It would benefit from crustier croutons - they became dumpling like in my soup. The cheese they used was amazing though, and the broth was different than what I was used to - it seemed like an opaque chicken broth rather than a clear onion broth. In any case, I very much enjoyed it.

My husband loved his chili mac. The onion rings were not my favorite as I prefer beer battered, and these were large and thin. I still ate them with gusto, though.

I appreciate restaurants who are able to keep their kitchens open until midnight. It's a rarity during the pandemic, but late night eaters need a place to go!

Finally, the dining room is packed with framed family photos, which is really heartwarming. I would love if some of them had descriptions so I knew what I was looking at.

I'm glad Biggies is in the neighborhood.

Update! My family and I went to Biggie's last night, September 1st 2022. We were all exhausted. There were tons of stuff on the floor, and we were very well attended too. I got the fried Chicken special and it was so good! I had the French onion soup again and loved it again.

131,Biggie's Restaurant,1,"This is one of our favorite restaurants and have been going there for years.  But today I was extremely disappointed because I wanted to book an area for a party of 14 people to celebrate my husband's 75th birthday for late June.  Family and friends coming in from all over the country.  But the manager said he could not take any reservations for any reason.  In these times you would think he would be anxious to rebuild the business and to accommodate a good customer for a very special occasion.  This would have been a big bill with drinks and a big tip for his staff.

If owners read this I would like a response.

I would like to add to this review.  We decided to eat inside during off hours.  The music playing was loud and hard rock.  Since there was only one other table of four we didn't think its was rude for us to be moved away from the speaker in the ceiling or for music to be changed.  Server acted put out for our request.  They changed to a good channel but then immediately turned it off completely.  She continued her rudeness.

Then as we were leaving I noticed that there was a table preset for a party that was not there so apparently you can get a reservation or call ahead for a reserved area for a large party.  Guess you have to be special, family or know someone to get treated like a valued customer.

I had the Farfalle and Chicken liver  plate, which unfortunately I did not like at all, the mushrooms in it were quite overpowering.

I let the server at the bar know my meal was incorrect and explained I should have fries (which I confirmed over the phone.)What he said to me was ‚Äúwe‚Äôll it‚Äôs to late‚Äù for that since my meal was made and they where busy. The servers are more concerned with selling a drink to the customers at the bar vs the customers who place orders. I feel it‚Äôs not to late for anything if I‚Äôm paying my money and I haven‚Äôt left this establishment yet. I waited another 6 minutes for another worker to approach me and ask what I was waiting for. I informed her I was waiting on fries, she proceeded to tell me she could charge me which was unacceptable. After telling her I wanted a refund for everything because I did not appreciate the encounter and just overall experience she went ahead and corrected the item. While handing me my food there was no communication of ‚ÄúSorry about that‚Äù, ‚Äúhere you go‚Äù, ‚Äúhave a nice night‚Äù ANYTHING as if I upset her. It definitely should not have gotten to that point but moving forward this will be my last time patronizing this establishment.

We arrived at 12:50, sat at a table in the room with the dart boards, no one else was seated in the room except for a table with 2 women who were already eating their food, a male server immediately came to our table and took our drink order and food order, promptly came back with our drinks, and that was it‚Ä¶.he never ever came back again with our food.

He never offered to refill our drinks, never apologized that our food was not out yet, and even after trying to get his attention several times, he still ignored us. Finally after 1 hour and 10 minutes, we were able to stop a female worker to ask her where our food was and could we speak with the manager. She was not kind at all and made it very clear that she could care less, informed us that our server was the manager, and simply walked away. We said that was it, got up and began walking out. As we passed our server/manager while walking out, we told him that we were leaving, and he didn‚Äôt even say he was sorry‚Ä¶.nothing at all to try and make it better.

217,Blueberry Hill,1,"Tried to get lunch here today.  Ordered toasted ravioli appetizer upon sitting down, as well as burgers.  Twenty-five minutes later, still no sign of even appetizers.  We asked for our check, wanting to pay for our drinks and leave, telling them we were going elsewhere.  The ravioli then appeared.  I asked to speak to a manager and was refused.  The server assured me he could help me.  I told him he should comp the ravioli, or the drinks, or something.  The restaurant was half empty after all.  Terrible service for a Saturday lunchtime.  He refused.  So I never actually spoke to a manager.  I did talk to the bartender on the way out and he assured me he'd pass along my issues.  Anyway, we wanted to have a nice meal, instead left in a bad mood.  Definitely won't be going back.  Hopefully I can save you the trouble too.  They are SUPER slow.  And have no qualms about it.  No recourse for customers.  Just pay and leave.  So we spent 25.00 for a couple sodas, a cocktail, and some toasted ravioli that honestly tasted like they could have come out of my toaster oven, and really horrendous service.  I've never had a server refuse to let me speak to a manager.  The bartender was a nice guy at least.  Oh well.

Edit in response to owner comment: Our server was a light skinned black male, short in height, medium length curly hair.  He was very nice, but frankly seemed lost and clueless on the floor.  Moving slowly and without purpose.  The waiter I flagged down and asked about a manager was a skinny blond kid.  He was very dismissive of my concerns. (I did see a few waiters, a young lady, and two gentlemen who looked to be a bit older (thirty maybe?) than the rest, who were all hustling).  The bartender was friendly and apologetic.

There's all types of memorabilia kept in glass cases throughout the restaurant. From old Barbie to Simpsons items...just all types of toys and items for the big kid in all of us. Then there's big taxidermy animals hung up on the walls throughout including a lion standing up that you can see from the outside window.  Other places on the wall has pictures and album covers from some people/bands I've heard of, but some I hadn't. I just love the ambiance of Blueberry Hill then to have great music playing over the speakers what more can you ask for. This is too cool for you not to visit.

We had dinner and I included pictures of that as well. I had the fish and chips and they were good. I was definitely full upon leaving here as was my partner. Upon entry, you have to have a mask on. They also do contact tracing where they have you sign your name and number on a form just in case anyone tests positive for covid-19 they'll be able to contact everyone in the restaurant on that day/time. I thought that was a good thing.

The establishment seemed clean to us and had partitions to separate the booths. Parts of the restaurant were closed as well. We seated ourselves and was immediately greeted by the waitress who was very cordial.  This establishment has street parking, but we had to park about a block down as Delmar Loop area is always busy and parking can be crazy at times. The establishment is wheelchair accessible as well.

Go and enjoy, but make it a family night as the kids will love to look at all the fun stuff around the restaurant while asking you questions about it.

I would recommend only coming here for drinks & music though. The food used to be really good, but it seems to have gone downhill unfortunately. I understand the labor shortage & have been in the industry for almost 30 years, so I know how hard it is to find good help. But you really need to change your fryer oil more often. Maybe it gets changed on Mondays & we just happened to be there on Sunday after a busy weekend, but the fish & chips & chicken tenders were inedible. My daughter ordered the filet medium rare, it came out medium well & it was not the texture of quality meat. My other daughter said her turkey sandwich was good. Potato skins were ok, potato soup was not. Our server was wonderful & attentive as were the hosts & I still love the vibe at McGurk's. We didn't complain about our meal to our server because honestly, anything that came out of that fryer was going to be gross & I'm not looking to get anything comped.",0.2968253968253968,0.6365079365079366,0,0,1

326,The Lou Eats & Drinks,4,"I have visited this place several times but it wasn't until my last 2 visits that I realized that The Lou St.Louis is charging double taxes for food and drinks. Pay attention to your bill. If you order potato skins @ $10.00, why does the receipt read $10.40, if I add additional toppings @$3.00, why does my receipt read $3.12. Their system automatically charges these extra pennies add up when people are not paying attention and I have paid attention and called them out on it. My bill was reduced by $3.26 in extra charges. IDK how much money I have or how little money I have it's my money/pennies and I don't like for people to try and get over on people and that's what the owner of this business is doing.
Yes the food is good and service is ok, but to make you pay extra is NOT cool, neither is making you pay 20% gratuity if you are dining alone or with another people.
I will be sure to tell everyone I know about this as well as calling

332,The Lou Eats & Drinks,3,"Well, we were starving and by the Arch, so after a quick Google search, we ended up here.

The space is nice. It had a pleasant atmosphere and a fair amount of people hanging out both at tables and at the bar. They have a really impressive wall of shots that I would love to try. Some of them sound absolutely fantastic.

My friend got a burger, and thought it was fantastic. I got The Lou Sandwich ($10), mostly because I haven't had provel cheese and I know that's like, a ""thing"" in STL. The sandwich was pretty good (so was the cheese, I get it).

Where it lacked was service. The server didn't seem to really care that we were there, and it wasn't super busy. We could see her chatting at the bar. She didn't check on our drinks, never checked on us, pretty much threw our food on the table and didn't come back until we needed to pay.",0.4222222222222223,0.6462962962962963,0,0,1

My kids finally got there food, and where 3/4 of the way done before my husband and I finally got our food. My sandwich was ice cold, so clearly it had been sitting. I would have brought these concerns up to our server had she ever actually checked on us. Our drinks went completely empty and never once offered a refill as we watched our server stand behind the bar on her phone. The kicker here is a friend of mine and his 5 friends came in 35 minutes after us, and got their food before us!!! Oh and not to mention I had to pay a 20% gratuity to a server who definitely did not deserve 20% of a bill for a family of 5.

412,Beffa's Bar & Restaurant,3,"For my birthday, my husband told me to pick a place of my choosing. He suggested quite a few restaurants $$$$+ but after about an hour of google-mapping almost a hundred places, I decided on Beffa's because of three images I saw (chicken and waffles, a fire looking chicken sandwich and the most delicious looking biscuits and gravy I've ever seen).
We drove over an hour from Warrenton; parking was easy as it was behind the building and easy access, first floor.
The server was kind, and when I asked about the three images he said those were brunch specials and the chicken sandwich was a special from a while ago.
I guess I should have called, so it was my bad, not theirs.
I wasn't really impressed by the menu as I glanced over it -- it seemed different from the images I viewed on maps, so I asked for the servers recommendation. Eventually, my husband and I both decided to split his highly recommended pork sandwich.
It took a while for our plate to come out and when it did arrive, it didn't look as described. The pork was very bland and parts of it was inedible because it was rubbery. The broccoli overwhelmed the sandwich to where we couldn't taste anything else. It was just very bland and disappointing.
The coleslaw and fries, however, were very good -- and you could tell the ketchup and ranch were made from scratch. üòçüî•
The woman behind the counter was so very, very sweet, so their customer service is the only reason I gave the place more stars.
I've never been here before to know if they're just having an off day or what, but I was very disappointed, especially for a birthday lunch/dinner. Maybe they're short staffed because of covid, so I may try them again in the future for brunch.",0.03894557823129252,0.7268962585034012,0,0,1

1. Get on the wait list ASAP! Even though the website said they weren't busy, they were packed and we waited over 30 minutes.
2. There's a parking lot right next door where you pay $1/hour. Not a bad fee, although we got lucky finding someone leaving that paid for the day.
3. They have food and drinks available,  but close down the kitchen from 2-3. We opted for the 2 for $5 cookie deal and they were the best cookies we'd EVER had!
4. There's so many board games to choose from, check out the list on their website ahead of time and do some research.
5. They have a great system of getting help with drinks, ordering food or games right at the table. Ask anyone, they are very helpful!
6. You pay $5/person to play the games, but children under 12 are free. They do discounts based on food or drink purchases though, so that helps.
7. Check their website for deal days when game fees are waived. Think fun girls night or date night with friends.
8. For a family of four we spent $30 with tip for 2.5 hours of games and 4 large cookies. We are already planning our next trip!",0.24052343159486014,0.3796296296296296,0,0,1

I was exploring Soulard on foot, and went in looking for a restroom before I ate.

I went inside the restaurant itself. There was no one at the door and no indication of whether I should seat myself. I had a seat at an empty table...and sat there for some time. No one came with water or a menu or anything, though servers were coming and going. Finally I noticed this little...canister in the middle of the table with three different colored flags, one to signal you wanted food, so I put that up.

This brought a server right to my table, and they said, ""Are you joining the party back there?"" and gestured to a full table. I said, ""...No?"" They said, ""Have you been here before?"" No. ""Was there someone at the door to tell you how things worked?"" Again I said no. ""Okay, what can I get for you?"" I was like, ""...A menu?"" Then another server brought me water before that person returned with a menu and water. I was like, ""Okay, is this the first puzzle?"" üòÖ

Anyway. I ordered an Edith Grey tea and the Midwest Poke Bowl. I appreciate the numerous veggie options. I asked the server about one-person games and several were suggested and explained well. I picked one out to try, then noticed my phone was dying and spent some time finding the power bank and cords in my bag.

The poke bowl came out before I'd gotten through the instructions, which was fine. It was delicious, even with tofu in place of fish. Lime was really unexpected and very tasty. At about this time I started noticing some coordination issues, and my activity tracker buzzed to let me know my heart rate was high. I've had some issues with vertigo that have been exacerbated this week, so I took meclizine I'd brought with me, but it was only getting worse. I ordered an Uber and my phone DIED right as I confirmed it! The staff were wonderful in helping my dizzy, frustrated self find a place to charge my phone and trying to help me stay calm. I was upset to have to leave so suddenly, but what I was able to eat of the poke bowl was delicious, and I hope to return another time.",0.17115440115440114,0.5576695526695526,0,0,1

We were under the impression that the games were free to play or at least a decent price. The fee to play a game is outrageously high. It‚Äôs like buying a new board game for my group of 6 people.

474,Pieces Board Game Bar And Restaurant,1,"I now refer to this place as ""gouges."" I tried going there for my birthday in March,  and it was an hour wait (which didn't work for us). They also required masks after everyone else in the city had stopped, which wouldn't be a huge deal except they were also charging for them.

Fast-forward 6 months and a friend wants to go there for her birthday,  so we get reservation which meant $45 for a room :/

Then we want a cake, which we aren't allowed to bring ourselves, and costs $30, but somehow they need 5 days advance notice as well,  so we're just out of luck.

Then when we come inside after eating cupcakes outside,  and they inform us there's a $5 per person ""library fee"" because somehow it costs them $2600 A MONTH to keep up their library of board games. You can of course mitigate this fee by $1 for each menu item you buy,  so if you rack up a giant bill there, it goes away.

You can buy Axis & Allies yourself and come out ahead if you play it 2x for what it cost to put 6 people through an evening of board games here.

As a group of college students,  the surprise charges that kept piling up as we commited to a sunk cost fallacy became the highlight of the night. Not the kind of person that leaves bad reviews often,  but they made me mad.

The drink menu is just as good, with a solid range of cocktails and beer. The wine selection is very short. The creativity of both food and drink is stellar and definitely well thought out. Be prepared to wait. At 6 pm on a Friday the wait was an hour. Coupled with a tight bar area makes it very crowded. But, this shows how popular it is quickly becoming! And, rightly so... Because I will definitely be back, which takes us to the best part, the games!  Literally, I had no idea this many games existed and they even have a section for games made by st Louisans. You can stay at long as you want and don't even need to keep eating or drinking. There is a $5 'library fee' per person which is totally worth it because somehow, someway, all of the games are in excellent condition. For each item you order, drink or eat, one dollar gets subtracted from the library fee.

We wish we had known and will try to grab a seat out there for next time. Chelsey was an amazing server. Followed all covid guidelines and made sure our drinks were filled and our stomachs too!
We had the edamame dip. This was a confusing dish to understand. But....still delicious. We also had the Mediterranean Beef Skewers and the Smoked Mac n Cheese was AMAZING.

I loved the spicy jalapeno and cucumber margarita with tajin but my partner Greg had them make him a regular margarita with white tequila and salt rim that was equally delicious.

Pro tip. Order a pizza to show up at the end of your meal. We were staying at the Union Station Hotel and brought home the White Pizza.

We would like to return when there is not a game going on. I love the Cards but we want to sit up on the deck overlooking the city. Unfortunately it was quite crowded because of the game and being immunocompromised I would rather be around less people.

We stayed at the Hilton over the 4th of July and were so excited to go check out this rooftop bar.

The hostess with the mostess 1/20/22 night was so sweet and it felt as if we met before. Beautiful soul and her smile was honest...The 1st person we met laid the blue print for the rest of out time

Maddie was nothing short of phenomenal. She was funny and knowledgeable about the menu. She was attentive and made sure we had everything we could possibly need.

The drinks we PERFECT long Island and Rum punch... let's just say we felt like we had zero cares in the world.

The food:
HOT...FRESHLY MADE...PRESENTATION WAS ON POINT...AND DELICOUS.

SOUTHWESTERN EGGROLLS: Delicious
Social Potato skins you've never tasted any like this.. we're from new orleans. . ..we know food.. these were potato skins filled  hot melty cheese, chicken with a drizzle of sauce. Delicious

Shrimp poboy: typical looking poboy but their special sauce makes this poboy stand out. AWESOMENESS

Smash burger: I couldn't put my finger on it but this burger got my attention as soon as I bit into it. The actual burger patty is seasoned ...My mouth is watering thinking about it now. The brioche bun was greatness.

Buffalo chicken tenders were strips. There's a light crisp to them. ... sauce pops nothing special but very satisfying .

My server was there quickly and was quite nice. I ordered a water, a glass of Grand Marnier, and the southwest egg rolls. Water in a tall clean glass, the Grand Marnier...three sides of four of the glass they brought was absolutely sticky and disgusting with lipstick on the rim...I wondered to myself, the bartender picked up the gals and did not notice? The server picked up this glass and did not notice? I kindly pointed it out and received a new glass (clean).

The egg rolls were quite good.

I then ordered another grand Marnier, and the Shrimp Po boy. The po boy was bland, but still decent. The fries were potato flavored salt licks, soggy, limp, saturated with sodium.

I then paid and re-sat at one of the two bars. The lights under the bar top are overly bright.
Everywhere you try to look at a tv to see a game(or whatnot) there are pillars, ceiling, the bar itself blocking your view from most areas. The bartender was friendly, and overly sharing about things.

I'm not sure if I will be back.
Cons
-dirty glasses/ inattentive
-lighting brighter than needed
- food seems hit or miss( no signature dish)

As the second table to order food, we expected to eat shortly after the 1st table. After 45 min when everyone was finishing eating and paying their bills, we were asked if we wanted our checks. We told the staff that we didn't get our food and their response was that our appetizers take longer to cook. Rather than telling us they forgot to place our order, they lied and tried to play it off. After another 15 min our group had paid their bills and mostly left. We flagged a staff member down to tell them to forget it and just charge us for the drinks. Shortly after the manager came out and tried to convince us to wait and it's almost ready. We had to affirm that we are refusing the food to the bartender, waitress, and manager. After making it clear, the manager backed down.

Completely different theme and vibe. This is now a place that you can bring your wife (perfect date night)and or kids, or just go with your friends.
The food. SPECTACULAR!! I had the lobster roll, and I felt like I was in Maine, it was fresh and cooked perfect. My wife had the Beef tenderloin Steak and it was tender with the perfect seasoning.
The pricing. VERY reasonable , especially considering the high quality of food that they use.
I was concerned about parking at first (being that it is in the Soulard/downtown area), but they have a huge, safe, lighted, parking lot next to the restaurant.
I rarely write reviews but this restaurant is worthy.

705,Rosalita's Cantina,4,"First time dining here. My friend Kevin had suggested it as he had been there once before. The first thing that caught my attention was the swiftness of most of the servers getting the meals and things back and forth. I thought it was a pretty busy place for a Monday night. The server who waited on our my table was polite enough but there were moments when I felt like she had forgotten about us. The appetizer plate that. I ordered was going to be the only food I was going to eat. Kevin had ordered a regular size meal plate and it took a while lot longer for it to brought to the table after I was given mine. The non-sweet tea was weak as expected and when I was able to get my server's attention for a refill she actually took it upon herself to pass the new glass of tea over the entire table not once but twice during my meal to put it directly in my hand. When we were nearly finished she had briskly walked by our table, glanced down and simply asked ,"" Will this be on one check"",  as kept on walking without stopping to even listen for a reply. I brought that aspect to her attention but her apology lacked a certain sincerity. I understand a certain amount of gratuity is to be expected at a restaurant like Rosalitas but the tip  should also reflect the thoroughness of the server's efforts.",0.08565361406270496,0.44827382213745853,0,0,1

716,Rosalita's Cantina,2,"This was a hard rating to give. On the upside our food was excellent and the wait was fairly short. On the downside our waitress was rude and inattentive, my order was changed last minute, and we were not told about an extra charge on our bill.
I understand supply chain issues and staff shortages, so I wasn't upset when told they were out of something. But after I placed my order and everyone else received their food I was again told they were out of everything i ordered. Then when I tried to change my order someone from the kitchen came out and told me they had half of my order available and asked if I wanted additional of that to replace what they were short. Which I did. The food was good, but one of my tamales was completely empty, no fillings inside.
The other issue was with the bill. We reserved a table for 11 people. We weren't seated together. We arrived at different times, had our orders taken at different times, and weren't close enough to talk to each other. We were exactly like separate parties, yet we were charged the 18% fee for large parties. Worst of all, we were not told about it and never saw a receipt. I was just handed the card reader with the total on it. Someone at our table left a cash tip so we essentially tipped almost 50% on some of the worst service I've had.
Needless to say we will not be going back.
Also, there's no parking. We paid $20 to park in the City Museum lot.",-0.04176190476190477,0.47014285714285714,0,1,1
